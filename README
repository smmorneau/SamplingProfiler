Summary:
A profiler that determines which methods in a program take the most time to 
    execute.
Uses a Java agent with a premain method that creates a thread that wakes up 
    every 1ms and figures out with method the main thread is currently 
    executing.
Counts how many times the thread wakes up in each method and calculates a 
    relative ratio of the time spent in each method.
Uses a shutdown hook to correlate the data and output it to standard out.

Usage: 
java -javaagent:sampler.jar SomeTestProgram
